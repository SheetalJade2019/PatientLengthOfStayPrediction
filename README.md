# Patients Length Of Stay Prediction

### Introduction

Nowadays hospital needs to maintain balance in treating each patientâ€™s condition even though population is increased. So, Hospitals are trying to increase efficient use of hospital resources.

### Aim

The objective of this system is to predict Length of stay of patient accurately using supervised machine learning techniques.

### Working

* The working of this system is divided in 3 main parts 
    
           1) Pre-processing of data 
           2) ML model 
           3) Testing of model. 
* The pre-processing step involves data analysis and visualization to find out missing values & outliers. Label encoding method is used for categorical features and scaling to reduce effect of outliers on prediction. 
* Next step is ML model training where we tried machine learning classification algorithms like adaboost, decision tree, gradient boost and Random Forest Algorithms.
* Here 80% data is given for training and 20% given for testing.
* This system will result in reduced waiting time for patients.

### Limitation 
 *  Accuracy improvements needed
 *  Large processing time

### Software used

To experiment it, I have used Intel(R) Core (TM) i3-2350 CPU @ 2.30GHz 2.30GHz processor and 4GB RAM 64-bit operating system.
